## Application
Note-taking applications are a very helpful tool for quickly jotting things down, keeping track of lists, and
drafting messages or documents. Hosting the storage of notes in the cloud provides the added benefit that
users can access their notes from multiples devices without losing their notes if a device is lost or broken.
Unfortunately, this also means that the note-taking service provider has access to all of a userâ€™s notes. This
is especially bad as note-taking tools are frequently used for short-termstorage of sensitive information

# Description
This project is a back-end for a private note-taking system  built using Python and Python's <em>cryptography</em> library. 
This system allows for the benefits of cloud storage without compromising user privacy along the way. Many symmetric 
cryptographic primitives such as symmetric ciphers, block ciphers, hashes, padding, and key derivations are used to
uphold secruity and prevent swap and rollback attacks.
